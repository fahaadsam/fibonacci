# fibonacci
Write a simple program to implement solution to this problem using CORE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE that you APPLIED IN SODING. Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ... By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
